# Australian-Housing-Dashboard
To create the dashboard, I haved performed necessary steps for cleaning and transforming data:
- used first row as headers
- checked if postcode has been sorted
- removed duplicated column like postcode, address2
- filtered property type column as only house and unit was needed
- removed outlier on sale price. Also, changed sale price to whole number
- changed sale date to date format
- removed 'N/A' when showing relation between number of bedrooms and sale price
- removed 'N/A' when showing relation between sold by and sale price
